Not Space Invaders
==================
Not Space Invaders is a game very much like the good old Space Invaders, but where the player is the villain. This means you play as the aliens and try to destroy the humans preventing the invasion.

Choose one of the invaders using the arrow keys and press [Space] to shoot!

Not Space Invaders was created in less than 48 hours for Ludum Dare 25, a game-making competition. On the 25th edition the theme was "You Are The Villain".

Not Space Invaders was created using almost exclusively free software:
- GNU Emacs;
- GIMP;
- Lua;
- LÃ–VE;
- SunVox; (not free software)
